What's new in release 2.0?

- No external dependencies. Now Backload references only system dlls.
- MVC 5 compatible (see demo project)
- All files (server and client) are now in the ~/Backload folder.
- The integrated controller is now in your project (~/Backload/Controller/BackloadController.cs)
- The controller has a new controller path: /Backload/FileHandler
- Brand new API to access most functions from your custom code (e.g. controller)
- 50% new or refactored internal code
- Optimized memory usage
- Chunked file uploads for all supported client side plugins
- New code to support PlUpload from MoxieCode and Fine Uploader from Widen Enterprises
- Using the new Json field names recently introduced in JQuery File Upload Plugin (see below)
- Most recent version of the supported client side plugins are included (~/Backload/Client)
- New options in the configuration (more here ~/Backload/Config/_Defaults/Defaults.txt)



Important migration notes:

- Event handler: If you attached to events, FileUploadStatus and FileUploadStatusItem have been renamed to:
  FileStatus and FileStatusItem in the namespace Backload.Contracts.Status. In your event handlers you must
  change the interface names and namespaces.

- Configuration: New Web.Backload.xsd schema file must be referenced in the Web.Backload.config file (If you open the 
  new schema file (Web.Backload.xsd) there is a comment with the version).

- Web.config: The version of the Backload section must be set from 1.9 to 2:
  <section name="backload" type="Backload.Configuration.BackloadSection, Backload, Version=2, ... />  

- Javascript: The controller has a new path: /Backload/FileHandler. There is a fallback.

- JQuery File Upload Plugin (Views): Release 2.0 uses the new Json field names introduced recently in 
  the Client side plugin from bluimp: e.g. delete_url -> deleteUrl, thumbnail_url -> thumbnailUrl, delete_type -> deleteType, etc.
  You may need to rename the related fields in the template the client plugin uses in your view.

- Bundeling: New bundle naming schema (~/Backload/Bundles/BackloadBundles.cs). Example: "~/backload/blueimp/bootstrap/BasicPlusUI" 
  for the jQuery File Upload Plugin Basic Plus UI theme. There is a fallback.
